# Syrian agricultural data acquisition

> [!NOTE]
> This Repository contains only documentation about the proposal of the Smart Farming 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Software , hardware , mechanics , testing etc... are to be developed under separated GIT repositories und linked here , this is the main repository to explain the systems that we are trying to develop.

> [!CAUTION]
> please use a new PR to add new documents don't add them directly to main branch

## About SGRD

## Introduction

## On the Problem and Proposals 

### General questions    
The main focus of this initiative is to understand the root of the problems that are facing the agricultural sector currently in Syria.

this research is trying to answer the following questions : 
- What was the situation of climate and agriculture in Syria between 2000 and 2011 ? 
- How did the conflict effected those two sectors between 2011 and 2025 ? 
- How did was those challenged countered in those years ?
- How dose those problems effect the live of the syrian people (specially in rural areas) ? 
- What is the impact of the "حوض الفرات"(AR) (Hou'th Al-Furat) project that was the main and leading project of the past government in this sector?
- Is the "حوض الفرات"(AR) (Hou'th Al-Furat) project still efficient , and if so how can we improve/restore it ? 
- Can new technologies help to solve those problems , if so what kind and what part of the problem can they solve?
- Are those new technologies scalable enough to scale to the entire eastern and north-eastern part of the country ? 
- Are those new technologies scalable enough to scale to the entire western and north-western part of the country ? 
- Are those new technologies scalable enough to scale to the entire middle and southern part of the country ? 

### Questions on agricultural sector 
- What is the situation according to the "Remote Sensing" of the agricultural land around the following areas : 
  
    - Euphrates
    - Coastal area
    - Khabour river
    - Yarmouk
    - Orontos
    - Al-Badia 
    - Barda & Awag

- what is the scale of damage (direct conflict-related damages (e.g., destroyed irrigation infrastructure)) on the following areas:

    - Euphrates
    - Coastal area
    - Khabour river
    - Yarmouk
    - Orontos
    - Al-Badia 
    - Barda & Awag

- what is the scale of damage ( indirect impacts (e.g., fuel shortages, sanctions, displacement of farmers)) on the following areas:

    - Euphrates
    - Coastal area
    - Khabour river
    - Yarmouk
    - Orontos
    - Al-Badia 
    - Barda & Awag

- what is the effect of farmer shortage in the following area (if there was shortage):

    - Euphrates
    - Coastal area
    - Khabour river
    - Yarmouk
    - Orontos
    - Al-Badia 
    - Barda & Awag

- what is the situation on the subject of fertilizers and seeds ( either in storage or able to be bought) ? 
- what is the situation of the fertilizers and seeds ( infrastructure like warehouses or storage units ) and how much accessability do the farmers have in the following areas : 

    - Euphrates
    - Coastal area
    - Khabour river
    - Yarmouk
    - Orontos
    - Al-Badia 
    - Barda & Awag
- How has livestock farming been affected, and what role could it play in recovery?

- What is the current state of agricultural extension services?

- What is the role of women in agricultural labor post-2011?

- Are there examples of successful low-cost or traditional farming methods being revived?
### Questions on climate sector 

- what is the situation on rainfall from 2011-2025 , is there a trend ? 
- how dose the global climate change effect the drought cycles in the region , is there a trend ? 
- revisiting the "الحزام الأخضر "(AR) ( green belt ) around cities , how efficient it was , how much is it damaged ? 
- Is the "great green Wall" initiative in Africa a good replacement for the green belt project in syria ? how much could it restore (estimated) in green land ( Al-Badia regressing ) ? 
-  what initiatives needs to be taken on level of legislation , investments and technologies could be implemented ? 
- How has temperature change affected specific crops (e.g., wheat, olives, cotton)?
- Are there zones where afforestation or re-greening has occurred naturally (passive recovery)?
- What is the correlation between shifting climate zones and rural migration?

### Socioeconomic & Humanitarian
- How has food insecurity fluctuated in the most affected governorates?

- What coping strategies are rural families using (e.g., urban migration, crop switching)?

- How has the rural youth population shifted demographically since 2011?

### Governance and Policy
- What are the legal and institutional barriers to land rehabilitation?

- What national or local policies are currently in place for climate adaptation?

- What role can Syrian diaspora or external researchers play in supporting the sector?

### Introduction to the challenges and problems of the agricultural sector and environmental issues in Syria    

This section aims to delineate the challenges believed to be impacting Syria's agricultural sector prior to the onset of the Syrian conflict and extending up to the conclusion of the hostilities in December 2025.
In this context, the following points are of particular relevance: 

* Current Agricultural Situation
- [ ] Research Syria's pre-war agricultural landscape
- [ ] Investigate war impact on agriculture in Syria
- [ ] Identify current agricultural challenges in Syria
- [ ] Document key agricultural regions and crops

* Land Desertification 
- [ ] Research extent of land desertification in Syria
- [ ] Identify causes of desertification in Syrian context
- [ ] Find existing restoration efforts and their effectiveness
- [ ] Document environmental factors affecting land restoration

* Damaged Farms
- [ ] Research extent of farm damage from the war
- [ ] Identify types of damage (infrastructure, irrigation, etc.)
- [ ] Find existing farm restoration efforts
- [ ] Document economic impact of farm damage

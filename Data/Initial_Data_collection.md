## Introduction
In this section of the project we shall put the first steps into the data acquisition for the proposal .

All those data were taken by google earth engine using remote sensing from different satellites on different bandwidth .  


More (TBD)

## Targeted data 

- Vegetation (NDVI, SAVI, EVI…)

- Precipitation (total, anomalies, seasonal trends)

- Temperature (min, max, average, trends)

- Drought (indices like SPI, SPEI, NDWI)

- Salinity (soil salinity indicators via remote sensing or field)
- Evapotranspiration (ET) (Water loss via evaporation and plant transpiration.) ( Dataset: MOD16 (MODIS ET), WaPOR (FAO))
- Land Use / Land Cover Change (LULC) (Tracks crop areas, fallow land, desertification.) (Shows impact of conflict, migration, or farming shifts.)
- Soil Type / Soil Properties (Affects water retention, salinity sensitivity. Global datasets: HWSD, SoilGrids )
- (TBD)

## Targeted areas

- east syria (3 states Der ez zor , alraqqah , alhasakah)
- dived into 4 sectors
- each sector divided up to 12 sub-sectors



## Time series

- year by year ( each year tack months)
- from 2000 to 2011 ( pre war )
- from 2012 to 2017 (rev start - migration crisis)
- from 2018 to 2024 ( after division to today)
